# Freshwater Aquarium Compatibility App (Flutter Version)

This application offers a simple comparison between common freshwater species for compatibility. It functions similar to species look up tables found online except with a simple user interface and ability to combine multiple species groups.

## Motivation

This project was completed as a challenge to myself to create my own application while in the process of learning Flutter & Dart. In addition to developing this Flutter version, I created a React-Native version of this app. A goal of this was to create a duplicate app of my own in both technologies to compare them.

## Installation

This application is not currently available on any app store. To build this app from the source code see this [tutorial](https://www.londonappdeveloper.com/how-to-clone-a-github-project-on-android-studio/) for details.
